Written Report: Draw three correct conclusions from the data for Pymaceuticals. 


The analysis of the animal study data for Pymaceuticals was performed on 248 mice (data for mouse ID g989 was removed prior to analysis due to duplicated sets of data under that mouse ID) identified with SCC tumor growth and treated with a variety of drug regimens. Tumor development within these mice was observed and measured for 45 days. This was done to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals drug Capomulin against other treatment regimens. 

The other drug regimen treatments were: Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Naftisol, Placebo, Propriva, Ramicane, Stelasyn, Zoniferol

Of these other treatment regimens, it can be observed from the bar chart analysis that the drug regimen Ramicane performed as equally well as Capomulin. Further comparison of the statistical summary of both treatment regimens Capomulin and Ramicane show nearly equal results. 

Additional analysis of tumor volume and four different drug regimens was completed, with results summarized in a boxplot. From this boxplot, the treatment Ramicane is still a contender with the treatment Capomulin. However, the boxplot reveals that the Capomulin data has a normal distribution whereas the Ramicane data has a slight skew. Per the box, the Ramicane data has a concentration of data at the median, but per the tails of the box, data continues to taper and is slightly skewed to the left.

We can further view the success of Capomulin as a drug regimen against SCC tumor growth by reviewing the line chart. Per the line chart, we can see that in mouse ID b128, the volume of the tumor is over time decreasing.
